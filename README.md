# Chinese Spam Classifier

This project is an archive of a spam classifier built for my students to use using the Naive Bayes model.

**WARNING: SHIT CODE**
Use at your own risk and I may or may not offer limited help as I am not experienced.

## Dependencies

- scikit-learn
- jieba
- joblib

## About the Data

The data is collected online, with the following format:

```text
<label> <text>
...
```

By default, it should be named as `labeled.txt` and placed in `./data` directory. You can change it as you wish.

On the other hand, the list of stop words is placed in `./data` as well, with the name of `stop.txt`.

Read the code yourself, and it should be easy to get this runnung.

## Instuction

Run

```bash
python main.py
```
